## Introduction
The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface to ask questions and receive answers directly from a CSV file using the OpenAI API. By combining the power of natural language processing and data visualization, users can gain valuable insights from their data in a convenient and interactive manner.

## Dataset
The project supports the use of any CSV file as the input dataset. The CSV file should contain the relevant data on which questions can be asked. Ensure that the CSV file follows the appropriate structure with headers and columns containing the necessary information.

## OpenAI API Integration
The OpenAI API is integrated into the project to enable the question-answering functionality. By utilizing the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model, the system can understand natural language queries and provide accurate responses based on the provided CSV data.

## Visualization
In addition to question-answering capabilities, the project offers interactive visualizations to gain insights from the data. The visualizations can include various types of charts, graphs, and plots, depending on the nature of the dataset. The visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

## Streamlit Web App
The project includes a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit. The web app provides an intuitive interface for users to upload their CSV file, ask questions, and visualize the data. The app combines the power of the OpenAI API and interactive visualizations to provide a seamless and engaging experience for users.

## Usage
To use the OpenAI Q&A and Visualization tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Gesskay/Question_CSV_openai`
2. Prepare your CSV file with the appropriate data and format.
3. Run the Streamlit web app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Access the web app through the provided URL.
5. Upload your CSV file, ask questions using natural language, and interact with the visualizations to gain insights from your data.
